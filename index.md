## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a junior studying mechanical engineering at Cornell University. At Cornell I have had the opportunity to be exposed to several aerospace related projects including CubeSats, ChipSat deployers, UAVs, aircraft & car engines, and wind tunnels. This past summer I interned at the Air Force Research Lab Rocket Lab at Edwards Air Force Base where I reverse engineering UAV flight envelopes and trajectories. 

Through these experiences, I have developed a passion for design, manufacturing, simulations, and testing. Cornell's rigorous engineering coursework and fast, startup nature of project teams have never ceased to present with challenges. I've enjoyed every opportunity to get hands-on and see immediate impact.
