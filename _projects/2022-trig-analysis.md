## I. Introduction
For the Spring 2025 semester, I joined the **Alpha CubeSat team** as a member of the Integration & Testing (I&T) subteam. My work on the **DeSCENT ChipSat Deployer** was temporarily put on hold until final flight hardware for Alpha CubeSat was assembled.  

As a new team member familiar with deployment mechanisms, I contributed to testing and assembly, including:  
- **Vibration testing**  
- **Thermal Vacuum Chamber (TVC) testing**  
- **Deployment testing**  

Additional responsibilities included preparing and testing CubeSats and supporting cleanroom assembly. After completing I&T, I returned to DeSCENT to run and document formal tests.  

## II. Major Assignments

Below are the five major assignments I completed this semester (chronologically), mostly alongside **Joshua Umansky-Castro** and I&T members **Apurva Hanwadikar, Cion Kim, Langston Hughes, and Italivi Diaz**. Latch displacement was measured after each test.  

#### A. Deployment Testing / Knot Tying
The Alpha CubeSat release mechanism consists of:  
- Solar panel roof  
- Milled aluminum latch and spring  
- Two fishing lines  
- Two burn wires  

**Goal:** Determine optimal knot and burn wire configuration.  

**Process:**  
- Tested different knot placements, wraps, and tension on test CubeSats  
- Selected configuration with:  
  - One burn wire per fishing line  
  - Non-obstructive glued knots  
  - Two wraps around the burn wire  
  - Simple double knots (tripled for strength) and slip knots to prevent movement  

**Outcome:** Deployment testing was successful; test CubeSats confirmed latch movement matched the flight unit.

#### B. Cleanroom Assembly
**Tasks:**  
- Assisted in assembling the flight unit before Nanoracks’ visit  
- Applied Loctite and torqued bolts according to specification  

**Challenges:**  
- Bolts could not be removed post-Loctite  
- Torque driver risked stripping bolts or damaging solar panels  

**Outcome:** Assembling flight hardware was challenging but built confidence and cleanroom experience.

#### C. Vibration Testing
- CubeSat loaded into payload holder and sent to Intertek for formal vibration testing  
- Observed test and confirmed hardware integrity after test

#### D. Thermal Vacuum Chamber (TVC) Testing
**Purpose:** Ensure CubeSat can withstand extreme temperature variations.  

**Process:**  
- Temperature sensors attached to key components (latch, battery, housing)  
- Monitored battery to prevent overheating  
- Observed solar panel bubbles; mitigated by small incisions or scraping  

**Outcome:** Deployment latch showed minimal movement, CubeSat passed TVC testing

#### E. DeSCENT Deployment Test
**Goal:** Conduct formal deployment test with **100 ChipSats**.  

**Process:**  
- Constructed two burn wire boards (vertical vs. horizontal orientation)  
- Set up real-time and slow-motion cameras with measuring tape  
- Activated bay door and launch bar burn wires  

**Outcome:**  
- Horizontally oriented burn wires preferred  
- All 100 ChipSats deployed successfully  
- Bulk reached ~20 inches height  
- Launch bars showed no defects

## III. Performance
This semester, I gained extensive hands-on testing experience and aerospace hardware knowledge. Key takeaways:  
- Adapted quickly to new mission goals  
- Collaborated effectively with team members  
- Enjoyed dynamic work sessions and after-hours engagement  

**Area for improvement:** Log more formal documentation to capture in-person discussions and test results.

## IV. Next Steps
- Analyze launch velocity from the latest DeSCENT test  
- Rebuild two DeSCENT boards with horizontal burn wires  
- Create formal DeSCENT test schedule  
- Continue rigorous testing to ensure mission success
