## Overview
The Glenn Curtiss Museum has many engines but few ways for visitors to interact with them. The Cornell University Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering Department is collaborating with them to generate augmented reality versions of aircraft engines.  One of these engines is the century-old Curtiss OX-5 V8 engine. 

In a team of four other students and under the guidance of Professor Brian Kirby, we designed and built a custom engine stand, successfully disassembled the engine into its separate components, replicated the parts in Fusion 360, and put together a complete 3D kinematic model.
During this project, I developed my CAD skills, learned how to use specific power tools, and furthered my understanding of piston-cylinder engines.
